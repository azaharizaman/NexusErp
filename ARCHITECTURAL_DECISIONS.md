# Architectural Decisions

## 2025-11-03 Panel Switching via User Menu
- Added Filament user menu actions in both `nexus` and `purchase-module` panels to generate deep links with `Filament::getPanel()->getUrl()`, providing the recommended panel-switching experience in v4.
- Restored the Nexus panel topbar so the shared user menu (and panel switcher action) remains accessible in the default location.

## 2025-11-03 Panel-Specific Branding
- Applied `brandName()` per panel so the topbar reflects the active module (`NexusERP` vs. `NexusERP - Purchase Module`), keeping navigation context clear for multi-panel users.

## 2025-11-03 Config-Backed Application Settings
- Replaced Spatie settings (classes, seeders, and Filament plugin) with a declarative `config/nexus-settings.php` array to simplify defaults management and unblock seeding in environments without persisted settings.
- Updated helper APIs to read from config so existing consumers continue to function while relying on stateless configuration.
