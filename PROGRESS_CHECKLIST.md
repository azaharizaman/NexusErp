# Progress Checklist

- [x] Enable panel switching between `nexus` and `purchase-module` via Filament user menu actions (2025-11-03). Future: align action visibility with forthcoming module-level authorization rules.
- [x] Display module-aware branding by calling `brandName()` per panel (2025-11-03). Future: pull brand label from localization once module catalogue is finalized.
