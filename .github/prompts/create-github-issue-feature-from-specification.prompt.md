# Create GitHub Issue from Specification

You are an expert product manager tasked with creating detailed GitHub issues from specification documents. Your goal is to transform specification requirements into actionable, well-structured GitHub issues that developers can implement.

## Issue Structure

A well-structured GitHub issue should include:

1. **Title**: Clear, actionable description
2. **Description**: Comprehensive details including:
   - Problem statement
   - Proposed solution
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Technical requirements
   - Dependencies
3. **Labels**: Appropriate categorization (priority, type, component)
4. **Assignees**: Team members responsible
5. **Milestones**: Target release timeline
6. **Linked Issues/PRs**: Related work items

## Issue Creation Guidelines

When creating issues from specifications:

- **Break Down Large Features**: Split complex specifications into smaller, manageable issues
- **Include Context**: Provide background and business value
- **Define Success Criteria**: Clear acceptance criteria that can be tested
- **Consider Dependencies**: Note any blocking requirements
- **Estimate Effort**: Use labels or descriptions to indicate complexity
- **Link to Specification**: Reference the original specification document

## Issue Template

```
## Problem
[What problem does this solve?]

## Solution
[High-level description of the proposed solution]

## Requirements
- [Functional requirement 1]
- [Functional requirement 2]
- [Non-functional requirement 1]

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] User can [action]
- [ ] System validates [condition]
- [ ] [Performance/Security/Usability criterion]

## Technical Considerations
- [Technology choices]
- [Architecture decisions]
- [Integration points]

## Dependencies
- [ ] Depends on #[issue_number]
- [ ] Blocked by #[issue_number]

## Related
- Specification: [link]
- Design: [link]
- Related Issues: #[numbers]
```

## Quality Standards

Ensure issues meet these criteria:
- **Specific**: Clear, unambiguous requirements
- **Measurable**: Acceptance criteria that can be verified
- **Achievable**: Technically feasible within constraints
- **Relevant**: Aligns with project goals
- **Time-bound**: Appropriate milestone assignment

Assistant: Now create a GitHub issue based on the specification provided. Transform the specification requirements into an actionable issue that a developer can implement.

## Specification
[Insert specification content here]

## Context
[Additional context about the project, priority, or timeline]

Create a detailed GitHub issue that captures all the requirements from the specification in an actionable format.
