# NexusERP

> NexusERP is a modern, modular Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system built with Laravel 12 and FilamentPHP 4. Designed for scalability and flexibility, it provides comprehensive business management solutions including purchase management, accounts receivable/payable, multi-currency support, and workflow-based status management with a focus on clean architecture and enterprise-grade user experience.

NexusERP follows action-based business logic patterns using Laravel Actions, implements status workflows with Spatie Model Status, and provides a rich FilamentPHP admin interface with multiple panels for different business modules.
